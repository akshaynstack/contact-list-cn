# Contact CRUD App using React

### Features (No need for extra features, just make the listed features)

- Fetch and show users from the api - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
- Add a contact, make a POST call to the above url (from where you are fetching) and save the contact in react state. (This will be a dummy request, you wonâ€™t be able to add contacts to the server. But the request is valid and will send you some data. Read the guide).
- Update a contact, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
- Delete a contact, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
